Migration of Wordpress Website to AWS

## Getting Started

  I use WordPress.com for writing blogs. I would like to launch a website of my own using AWS services and run and manage my WordPress content through them.
  This project highlights majorly on the objective of migrating my entire WordPress website content on AWS platform. This project will let you exploit the AWS services as per your requirement with much simplicity and ease.
